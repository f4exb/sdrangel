 This code generates an FIR filter with the frequency over-sampling method. By this we
 mean that we always sample the frequency domain at least 1024 times (a large power of
 2 suitable for an FFT) even though we typically want a relatively small number of FIR
 coefficients (< 50).

 Most authors use N frequency samples to generate N taps. While valid, this tends to loose a
 significant amount of frequency domain information if the tap count is small.

 Using a large number of samples will generate a filter equivalent to those generated with
 the equations for a classic Rectangular Windowed FIR filter. Those equations were derived
 by using an infinite number of frequency samples, which is to say, performing an integral.

 To see how well this works, use this code to sample a simple rectanglular low pass response
 and compare the results to the coefficients generated by Windowed FIR code used the
 BasicFIR() function in FIRFilterCode.cpp

 See the example code in FilterKitMain for an example of using SampledFreqFIR().
 This function is called after the HofSReal array is filled with the desired magnitude response.
 The only trick to this method is getting the phase set correctly. There are two aspects to
 setting the phase. Using the correct slope, which is the same for all filters, but does
 depend on even or odd tap counts. And we must ensure that the phase value is correct at
 Omega = 0.0 and Pi.

 If the filter has a low pass response (magnitude != 0.0 at DC), then the phase at Omega=0 must
 be zero. If the filter has a high pass response (magnitude != 0.0 at Pi), then the phase
 must be zero of Omega = Pi.

 A band pass filter, which has neither a low or high pass response, can have any phase value at
 Omega = 0 and Pi. But a Notch filter, which has both a low and high pass response, must have
 zero phase at both zero and Pi. The code below should make this more clear.

 NumTaps     Number of FIR taps
 FirCoeff    The output array for the FIR coefficients.
 HofSReal    The array containing the desired magnitude response.
 HofSImag    The imag part of the response (zero when this function is called).
 OmegaC      The center frequency. (Only needed for notch filters.)
 PassType    firLPF, firHPF, firBPF, firNOTCH  Needed to set the phase properly. (defined in FIRFilterCode.h)
