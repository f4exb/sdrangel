QGIS geojson export doesn't support styles (See: https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/issues/21195) so manually edit the geojson and insert:

    "stroke": "#ff0000" properties to set color. Negative blue, positive red, 0 green.
    "stroke-width": 0.5,  for contours that aren't multiples of 10 and 1.0 for those that are.
