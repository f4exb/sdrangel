# This CPACK_PRE_BUILD_SCRIPTS script is used to copy all required Qt and other 3rd party libraries (SDR drivers and codecs) in to the .app bundle
# It is run in a staging area (${CPACK_TEMPORARY_INSTALL_DIRECTORY}/SDRangel.app) after all targets have been installed (E.g. sdrangel exe and plugins)
# The copying of frameworks and libraries is mostly done by 'macdeployqt', however, in order for 'macdeployqt' to copy libraries built by external/CMakeLists.txt,
# we first need to add RPATHs into the libraries giving the locations of any libraries they might depend on. 
# These paths are in the variable MACOS_EXTERNAL_LIBS_FIXUP set in externals/CMakeLists.txt
# Is there an easier way to this?
